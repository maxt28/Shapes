Homework #2
You can create group in two ways:
  having ready group, or creating new one.
If you choose to create group by yourself you have to type shape's name ("circle", "triangle", "square") and give its parameters.
When your group is done just type "done" and programm will show your group on the screen.
Also it is creating xml file of your group called "file_xml.xml".
